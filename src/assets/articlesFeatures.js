    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter">The</span>coming academic year will see three major milestones of note for the Department: 100 years since the founding of UCLA, 75 years since the founding of the engineering school, and 50 years since the first ARPANET message. Each will be associated with major celebrations, and I invite our alums and other members of our ECE community to take full advantage of them to connect again with each other and to the many exciting developments now under way at UCLA. Some of these are reflected in the articles of this now fully on-line annual report. These anniversaries also provide an opportune time to reflect on what we have done well and what we could do better. </p><p>    One of the ironies of an organization that is responsible for many technological developments that have broad and life-changing societal impact is how slowly many processes of renewal work on the inside, sometimes leading to the perception that universities change on geological time scales. Perhaps it is the case that the more revolutionary the intellectual projects being attempted, the more stability is psychologically required in other aspects of work life. However, given the dizzying changes that have taken place in technology and more particularly in how design is actually practiced, we are now at the point where we must ask in what respects the structure of our degree programs must be changed, as compared to making evolutionary changes in courses and course sequences. The time has come to examine the entire picture from the point of view of what skills and concepts our graduates must master to be effective engineers for the coming decades. This was a major topic of discussion at our annual departmental retreat. Some ideas for ways forward we will be exploring are laid out below. </p><p>     It is clear that the tools used in design are radically different from when the School was founded, but yet the mathematical preparation in the undergraduate program still promotes the primacy of closed form solutions for modeling the world, with probability not introduced until junior year. In contrast, numerical analysis and stochastic inference are required for essentially all problems of any scale or degree of realism. Today’s very bright engineering students understandably want to know how the concepts they are learning apply to the world; the classic curriculum postpones the answer to this question, to the detriment of their enthusiasm for the subject, and to their ability to meaningfully contribute in summer internships. The two goals of our undergraduate program are to prepare students for varied careers in industry and graduate school. Thus connection of theoretical fundamentals with real-world applications needs to be made throughout the program. Professional development skills also need to be reinforced in the course sequences, while we also ensure all students have mastered the fundamentals of data science. All of this needs to be accomplished with no new resources, and no new unit requirements so that students can graduate in four years. Clearly this is a task for a department with expertise in constrained optimization!  </p><p>   The MS degree also serves a dual purpose: training to be a design lead in industry and mastery of the specialized technical literature required to pursue a Ph.D. Individual courses at the graduate level have been regularly updated to account for technological change, but soft skills training to navigate the essential fact of  dynamic career changes has not similarly kept pace. We also face the challenge of running a program that recruits globally but must serve a local market with a high demand for US citizens. Part of the answer is establishment of pipelines from the undergraduate program that include interaction with industry. Four years ago at the initiative of Prof. Chan Joshi we launched the Fast Track program which features guaranteed internships, encouragement to take honors courses, and additional advising. Among the goals were attracting a diverse and talented pool of undergraduate students who might continue to graduate studies. The first cohort had 14 students; this year 45 accepted our offer of admission, representing nearly 40% of our incoming class. In perspective, prior to the launch of Fast Track, the Department netted only 3-5 students per year from highly competitive pool from which the students are drawn; in the past year we equalized the admissions acceptance rate compared to our undergraduate program as a whole. Deepened partnerships with industry will be required to meet the internship guarantee and to ensure that more continue on with their studies to be prepared for technical leadership. The program is now in the capable hands of Profs. Rob Candler and Danijela Cabric. It has shown how enrichment activities can attract highly qualified students; we will look to extend this approach to our MS program while also applying lessons learned to our entire undergraduate cohort. </p><p>    Among the milestones we are celebrating this year is the generous gift of $100M by Prof. Henry and Dr. Susan Samueli to the School. We are presently about halfway through a first phase expansion of the size of the faculty that will add in the end 50 faculty positions. The gift is structured to enable UCLA Engineering to embark on a second phase of expansion, both to deal with record student demand for admission and to enable broadening the scope of research problems that can be tackled. The Department continues to broadly recruit, welcoming Prof. Lin Yang and Clarice Aeillo this year, with research in reinforcement learning and high-resolution microscopy for biological applications respectively. After 49 years at UCLA advancing the frontiers of communications networking, Prof. Rubin has retired.  </p><p>    As detailed further in this report, members of the Department have continued to innovate in their research, and have consequently received many honors. Major honors include The IEEE HKN Vladimir Karapetoff Outstanding Technical Achievement Award (Prof. Frank Chang), the HSSEAS Lifetime Achievement Award (Prof. Oscar Stafsudd), election as Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (Prof. Aydogan Ozcan), The IEEE HKN Visionary Leader and Pioneer Award (Prof. Asad Madni) and The Ellis Island Medal of Honor (Prof. Yahya Rahmat-Samii). Four new IEEE Fellows were elected: Profs. Warren Grundfest, Mona Jarrahi, Yuanxun Ethan Wang and Chee Wei Wong, while Prof. Wong was also elected a Fellow of SPIE and Prof. Rob Candler was elected a fellow of the AIMBE. Prof. Sam Emaminejad received an NSF Career Award, and many large extramural research grants were secured by the faculty.  </p><p>    Given the lifespan of universities, at 100 years UCLA is still a youngster, but yet it stands very tall among its global peers. The ECE Department has played a significant role in establishing this reputation in our even shorter history; I expect even greater accomplishments to come. Happy birthday, and Fiat Lux, UCLA!</p>    '

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent: 0;"><span class="first-letter">Clarice</span> D. Aiello is a quantum engineer interested in whether and how quantum physics informs biology at the nanoscale. She is an expert on technological nanosensors harnessing room-temperature quantum effects in noisy environments. </p><p> She is currently interested in "living sensors," namely microorganisms and cells that respond to minute stimuli and sometimes exceed by far the performance of the best technology today. There\'s evidence that organisms behave, for a short time, as "living quantum sensors" and are thus amenable to be studied and controlled using quantum sensing techniques developed for technological sensors. The Quantum Biology Tech (QuBiT) Lab will use such quantum sensing techniques to perform coherent quantum measurements and control on proteins, cells and organisms in order to understand how they interact with their environment, and how physiology is regulated by such interactions.  </p><p> <b>What can it all possibly have to do with human and organismal physiology? </b></p><p>   Yearly, and astoundingly, vertebrates (such as birds and turtles) and invertebrates (such as butterflies) alike navigate for thousands of miles partly guided by Earth’s magnetic field – which is weaker than the field in the proximity of a cell phone. The advent of wireless technology, incidentally, steeply increased human exposure to electromagnetic fields. Neither the health eﬀects nor the physiological mechanisms, if any, behind magnetosensitivity in organisms are well established. Importantly, recent evidence indicates that sensing magnetic fields might be more widespread and impactful for physiology than previously assumed. Weak magnetic fields were demonstrated to regulate: the production of reactive oxygen species in human cells; mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis rates in human cells; and stem cell growth in planaria. Crop growth and embryo development are also thought to be magnetic field-dependent. The Quantum Biology Tech (QuBiT) Lab’s quantum sensing-rooted approach will investigate the underlying physical mechanisms of organismic interaction with electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale. Having a nanoscale eletromagnetic handle onto cellular processes will enable the monitoring and selective stimulation or suppression of cellular functions. For example, electromagnetic fields could be applied in situ in order to reduce uncontrolled ROS proliferation (a hallmark of metabolic and degenerative diseases). Moreover, once chemical pathways of interaction with electromagnetic fields are well-established, a chemical taken as a drug could momentarily quench such pathways so that personnel are safe in areas with a high-dose of harmful electromagnetic radiation (military in disaster zones; astronauts in outer space). </p><p> <b>Can we quantum compute with in wet, hot environments?  </b></p><p> Quantum information processing’s public enemy number one is the fast loss of coherence found in the wet, hot environments of “living sensors”. The fundamental question of whether entanglement and coherence can survive at high temperature is of interest in quantum information theory and has led to developments in fault-tolerant quantum computation. We expect to make contributions, both theoretical and experimental, to the question of whether it is fundamentally impossible or possible to do quantum information processing with highly mixed decohered resources. </p><p>  <b>Cutting edge quantum sensing with technology refined over the past million years. </b></p><p> Quantum simulations of the molecular processes occurring inside “living sensors” suggest that they are highly optimized to work within environmental parameters that closely match the surroundings in which they evolved (e.g., highest sensitivity to magnetic fields of the magnitude of the Earth’s). Our goal is to determine whether and how such quantum-based molecular processes are optimized to their own environment, thus informing the engineering of bio-inspired electromagnetic probes, whose accuracy we foresee improving. Eﬀorts to frame the ultrasensitive, room-temperature molecular quantum sensing processes into the theoretical and experimental frameworks of quantum sensing are therefore in order if we are to harness the unequivocal choices of natural selection for technological advancement.</p>'

Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University working with Prof. Mengdi Wang. He obtained two Ph.D. degrees simultaneously in Computer Science and in Physics & Astronomy from Johns Hopkins University in 2017. Prior to that, he obtained a bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University. His research focuses on developing fast algorithms for large-scale optimization and machine learning. This includes reinforcement learning and streaming methods for optimization and function approximations. His algorithms have been applied to real-world applications including accelerating astrophysical discoveries and improving network security. He has published numerous papers in top Computer Science conferences including NeurIPS, ICML, STOC, and PODS. At Johns Hopkins, he was a recipient of the Dean Robert H. Roy Fellowship.</p><p> Recent years have witnessed increasing empirical successes in reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, it is an irony that many theoretical problems in this field are not well understood even in the most basic setting. For instance, the optimal sample and time complexities of policy learning in finite-state Markov decision process still remain unclear. Given a state-transition sampler, we develop a novel algorithm that learns an approximate-optimal policy in near-optimal time and using a minimal number of samples. The algorithm makes updates by processing samples in a “streaming” fashion, which requires small memory and naturally adapts to large-scale data. Our result resolves the long-standing open problem on the sample complexity of Markov decision process and provides new insights on how to use data efficiently in learning and optimization.</p><p>    The algorithm and analysis can be extended to solve two-person Markov games and contextual Markov decision problems while achieving near-optimal sample complexity. We further illustrate several other examples of learning and optimization over streaming data, with applications in accelerating Astrophysical discoveries and improving network securities. </p>'

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter">The</span> UCLA Samueli School of Engineering has received its largest gift ever: $100 million from longtime supporters Henry and Susan Samueli. The gift, made through the Samueli Foundation, will be used to spur the engineering school’s planned expansion, which is to continue well into the next decade and is its most significant growth since the school was founded in 1945. </p><p> UCLA Samueli plans to enroll at least 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students by 2028, up from 5,300 at the start of the expansion in 2016. The school will also seek to add approximately 100 professors over the same period of time for a roster of nearly 250. New faculty will be in emerging research areas, such as engineering in medicine, quantum technologies, and sustainable and resilient urban systems. </p><p>  “Henry and Susan’s extraordinary commitment to public higher education will benefit UCLA and our larger community for generations to come,” said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block. “Their generous continued support reflects their confidence in our university to serve the greater good.” </p><p>  In 2000, the engineering school was named in Henry Samueli’s honor following a $30 million gift that supported capital improvements as well as fellowships for graduate students and early career faculty. Since then, the Samuelis have made several additional gifts to the engineering school, including $10 million to support the establishment of endowed professorships and $20 million to support undergraduate students through scholarships and internships.  </p><p> “Susan and I are thrilled to be able to support the continued expansion of the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering,” Henry Samueli said. “The demand for engineering graduates has continued to grow unabated, so it is exciting to see UCLA’s significant commitment to increase the number of students and faculty, and expand research and entrepreneurship within the school. Such a commitment will ensure that UCLA Samueli remains among the elite engineering schools in the world, with an ever-growing impact on our society’s greatest challenges.” </p><p> A full-time professor of electrical engineering at UCLA from 1985 to 1995, Henry Samueli earned three degrees from UCLA: a bachelor’s in 1975, a master’s in 1976 and his doctorate in 1980. He co-founded Broadcom Corporation in 1991 and serves as chairman of the board of the company, which is now known as Broadcom Inc. Based in San Jose, California, the firm is one of the world’s largest semiconductor and infrastructure software companies. </p><p>  “Henry’s start mirrors that of so many of our students and alumni,” said Jayathi Murthy, the Ronald and Valerie Sugar Dean of Engineering. “He’s a first-generation American who used his engineering education to carve a path to success. His impactful and continuing contributions to the telecommunications industry have been nothing short of remarkable.” </p><p>     “On behalf of everyone at the school, I offer my deepest thanks to Henry and Susan for believing in our vision,” Murthy said. “Their philanthropy will allow us to educate even more students.” </p><p>    As part of its growth plan, the school also has expanded its infrastructure, adding two new buildings in the past 12 years. The latest is the 150,000-square-foot Engineering VI, which opened in March 2018, and houses the school’s growing computer science department and multidisciplinary research laboratories. </p><p>    Including today’s gift, the Samuelis have given more than $188 million to UCLA and more than $478 million overall to the University of California system. The gift is part of the Centennial Campaign for UCLA, which is scheduled to conclude in December 2019, during UCLA’s 100th anniversary year. Henry Samueli is the campaign’s Orange County chair.    </p>'
