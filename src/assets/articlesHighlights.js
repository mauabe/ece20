This could enable various planetary, cosmological, and astrophysical observations to be made without the need for cryogenic cooling. </p><p>     Radiation in the terahertz regime exhibits warm phenomena, such as formation of stars, planetary systems, and galaxy evolution as well as dynamics and atmospheric constituents of planets and comets. Formation of stars and planetary systems and various important phases of galaxy evolution happen in dust cloud regions, which obscure infrared and optical wavelengths. On the other hand, temperature range of the interstellar medium in these regions excites a wealth of spectral lines in the terahertz regime, which are not blocked by the interstellar dust. Many of these spectral lines have been investigated through several ongoing and completed observatory missions to study the evolution of galaxies, stars and planets; dynamics of interstellar medium of nearby galaxies; evolution of solar system and proto-planets; and cosmic origin of water on Earth and other planets.  </p><p>       Many of these observations require terahertz spectrometers with near-quantum-limited sensitivities to detect faint fluxes of terahertz photons emitted from galaxies that are thousands of light-years away. Such sensitivities have so far only been possible through the use of cryogenically cooled spectrometers kept close to absolute zero (-273 C˚) to work properly. Although cryogenic-cooling does not pose a substantial limitation to the ground-based instruments, it significantly constraints the lifetime and weight of the instruments carried by satellites. For example, the billion-euro Herschel observatory launched for terahertz observations, carried 2367 liters of liquid helium in a giant cryostat for cooling the terahertz spectrometers. The carried liquid helium weighed 335 kg, while the weight of the rest of the instruments was 426 kg. The lifetime of this observatory was limited to a total 22,000 hours of scientific observations, after which the liquid helium totally boiled away.  </p><p>       Prof. Mona Jarrahi’s group introduced a plasmonic detector capable of detecting faint terahertz spectral lines with quantum-level sensitivities at room temperature, for the first time. The key to the new detector is converting incoming terahertz signals, which are not easy to sense and analyze with standard scientific equipment, into radio waves that are easy to handle. For this conversion, the incoming terahertz signal is mixed with light in a semiconductor with embedded metallic nanostructures that are designed to enhance the interaction between the light and terahertz photons. Jarrahi’s group demonstrate terahertz detection sensitivities down to 3 times the quantum-limit at room temperature. With a versatile design capable of broadband operation, over a 0.1-5 THz bandwidth, this plasmonic detector has broad applicability to astronomy, cosmology, and atmospheric studies, as well as gas sensing. A paper detailing these results is published in Nature Astronomy.     </p>. '

They can be used to perform sophisticated signal processing function at a RF front-end, such as limiting a strong jammer while letting signals with weaker amplitude through. Even though it is well known that such nonlinear, frequency dependent behavior of the device is caused by the interaction of electromagnetic waves and spin waves in the material, quantitative prediction of the device performance has almost been impossible due to the cross-domain interaction of multiple dynamics and the nonlinear nature of such interactions. </p><p>    Sponsored by DARPA M3IC program, Prof. Ethan Wang’s group developed the first physics based nonlinear circuit model which can be an effective tool to design and predict such nonlinear RF magnetic devices. This work is published in the Aug. issue of IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques. The equivalent circuit model is structured and its parameters are determined rigorously from the fundamental physics of electromagnetic waves and spin waves. The spin motions as well as the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) behaviors are modeled by RLC parallel circuits with parameters derived from classical magnetic theory. The exchange coupling between spins is modeled by mutual inductors added between adjacent RLC resonators based on quantum spin theory. The nonlinear cross-frequency coupling from signal at ω to spin waves at ω/2 is represented by a nonlinear-coupled inductor model that follows the mathematics of a pendulum motion to represent the parametric oscillation behavior of spins. The circuit units are scaled and cascaded to describe the spin wave propagation inside the magnetic material of real RF devices, and transmission line parameters are added finally to describe the electromagnetic wave propagation. The model successfully predicts the power dependent insertion loss as well as the threshold power level, time delay, and frequency selectivity of the power limiting effect of measured FSL devices with sub-dB deviation in precision.    </p>'

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter">UCLA</span> has been selected to receive up to $5.9 million over four years from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for the Spintronic Stochastic Dataflow Computing (SSDC) project. The project is a collaboration between UCLA Electrical and Computer Engineering Department faculty Professor Kang L. Wang, Professor Puneet Gupta, and Professor Sudhakar Pamarti. </p><p> The SSDC project aims to solve computing and communication energy problems for data intensive applications like machine learning. Today’s computing systems follow the von Neumann architecture, which has physically separate memory and processing units. This architecture is unsuitable for big data applications that require vast amounts of data to move between the memory and processing units. This forms a “memory bottleneck” that represents one of the most pressing technical challenges of big data hardware that the SSDC project is trying to solve. </p><p>    Several applications include artificial intelligence, virtual reality, deep neural networks, and new computer architectures. Any applications that require processing of large amounts of data would benefit from this research.  </p><p>   The grant will be used primarily for the development of three new technologies. The first is a new memory called magnetoelectric random access memory (MeRAM) based on a voltage controlled magnetic tunneling junction (VCMTJ), which offers an attractive combination of size, non-volatility, energy efficiency, speed, and integration. The second is a new stochastic computing (SC) paradigm which enables ultra-compact units that can be parallelized and integrated with MeRAM on a large scale. The third development is an integrated circuit (IC) hardware that would integrate the MeRAM and SC on the same silicon die and achieve 60 times lower energy than the current best technology.</p> <p> <br><b>    Prof. Sudhakar Pamarti </b><br> Prof. Pamarti’s group specializes in integrated circuit (IC) design. His group will lead the development of read/write/control circuitry that will turn the VCMTJ device into the MeRAM. His group will also integrate the stochastic computing with the VCMTJ and develop more energy efficient integrated circuits.</p> <p> <br><b>    Prof. Puneet Gupta </b> <br>  Prof. Gupta’s group specializes in circuit design automation and computer systems architecture. During project development this algorithmic expertise will be used for stochastic computation, especially in training neural networks and developing new computing architectures. </p> <p> <br><b>    Prof. Kang L. Wang </b> <br> Prof. Wang’s group invented magnetoelectric random access memory and is the leader in the field. This is used for magnetic stochastic computing as well as a high performance low cost memory.</p> '

    textCopy: '<div><p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter">In</span>1973, UCLA computer science professor Jacques Vidal published a landmark paper, <span class="link"><i><a href=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.bb.02.060173.001105 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">"Toward direct brain-computer communication"</a></i></span> that both coined the term “brain-computer interface” and set the foundation for an emerging field.</p><p>“That whole concept of interacting with and sensing the brain – interpreting signals with a computer and controlling the cursor on a computer with the mind – that paper is pretty much the essence of it,” said Dejan Markovic, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and leader of the <span class="link"><i><a href=http://icslwebs.ee.ucla.edu/dejan/researchwiki/index.php/Main_Page target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Parallel Data Architectures Laboratory</a></i></span>. “The real question is: Can we build technologies that enable those types of things that are clinically sustainable, efficacious, and attractive to patients?”</p><p>Looking to answer that question, Markovic carries on the legacy of brain-computer interface research at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering. For nearly a decade, he has been leading the development of a device that would be implanted in the brain to help people with a range of neurological conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.  And he’s been working closely with doctors and scientists at UCLA and UC San Francisco who study the brain.</p><p>“The concepts laid out in 1973 by Vidal haven’t changed too much,” he added. “The brain and a computer can ‘talk’ to each other through electrical signals. The big thing that we are trying to change is to be able to quantify what those signals are, and affect functional networks of the brain.”</p><p>Markovic’s prototype is a small implantable device with sixty-four electrodes that fan out onto the brain’s surface. With four modules for each electrode, it constitutes a 256-channel system. The system measures tiny electric signals that tell what’s happening in the brain. The device then interprets that data, and responds with electrical pulses, which research has shown can alter mood.</p><p>In several ways, it is leaps and bounds more advanced than implants that have come before it. It’s much smaller for one. In fact it’s not immediately noticeable, unless someone’s really looking for it. It has a tiny battery than can be wirelessly charged. The device is also much more sensitive, able to detect and decipher very faint signals from the brain.</p><p>Finally, it’s a closed loop system – meaning that while still picking up the brain’s signals, it can modify the frequency and amplitude of the stimulating signal. The system brings much more data into the loop, giving  doctors and scientists more information about what’s happening in real time . Other devices only deliver a constant electric signal, while this new system offers a therapy  that can be more personalized to a particular patient</p><p>“Our technology could revolutionize non-pharmacological treatment of brain disorders,” Markovic said. “We want to be able to understand how various indications are expressed in the actual time waveforms, from specific points inside the brain.”</p><p>Markovic and UC San Francisco colleagues saw a major breakthrough in an experiment, which was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. A patient with severe anxiety was recorded before and after electrical stimulation was applied. The change in mood following stimulation was immediate and striking.</p><p>“For a person to say, ‘now I feel normal, this is me,’ that was the biggest impact point,” he said.</p><p>With a series of successful demonstrations, Markovic is now looking to commercialize the technology.  This includes miniaturizing the external device down to just four cubic centimeters. But first, why go with a brain implant in the first place?</p><p>“The brain is an electrochemical organ and the vast majority of our treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases focus on the chemical part,” explained Dr. Nader Pouratian, a UCLA neurosurgeon working with Markovic. “The goal with devices like the one that Dr. Markovic is creating is to target the electrical abnormalities that occur in the brain as a result of neurological and psychiatric disease.”</p><p>Added Markovic, “We are looking into patients that have tried pharmaceuticals. In some people, pharmaceuticals have some effect, but there are a sizeable amount of people where pharmaceuticals do not help.”</p><p>On a parallel track, Markovic’s technology also offers scientists a powerful magnifying glass into the inner workings of the brain. One of his collaborators is Nanthia Suthana, a UCLA assistant professor at the Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior who studies neuromodulation and neuroimaging.</p><p>“The research potential is really endless with such a device,” Suthana said. “Relevant to my own research field, we will be able to investigate the role of single neuron and local field potential activity in freely moving human behaviors such as in spatial navigation, learning and memory.”</p><p>“These newer details will allow us to better understand the neuronal mechanisms that support typical human brain functions as well as abnormalities that may occur in neurologic and psychiatric disorders such epilepsy,” she added.</p></div>'
